# WIRELESSDATATRANSMITTER
Transmitting data wirelessly  using 8051 microcontroller

Project Description:
•Basically, the main aim of the project is to transmit the data wirelessly.
•So, we give the input data from keyboard which is in interface with LCD display.
•The given input through keyboard is displayed in LCD. It displays whether data is transmitting or not.
•The input data through keyboard is being passed to micro controller.
•The code is being executed in the micro controller and the output is passed to Encoder.
•The Encoder encodes the digital output to analog form.
•This analog data signal is passed to RF transmitter.
•This data signal is received by RF module, which contains Decoder IC and LEDs.
•Decoder decodes the analog form of data signal to digital form.
•This digital data output signal can be shown with the help of LEDs in terms of its binary equivalent.
